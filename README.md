This is my professional website, which I created using jQuery/Bootstrap/Node as part of an early solo assignment in Prime Digital Academy. It is simple enough that maintaining it rather than overhauling it for the sake of doing it in a shinier (Angular or React) manner seems like a lower priority than starting other projects.

Original Prime Assignment -- Project Scope
-  Create resume website that improves upon existing navigation in mc-funk.github.io
-  Use Bootstrap
-  Use jQuery
