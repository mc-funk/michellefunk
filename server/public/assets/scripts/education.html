        <strong>Master of Public Policy,</strong> Advanced Policy Analysis, Aug. 2010-Dec. 2011
    </p>
    <p>
        I moved to Minneapolis to attend the Humphrey School of Public Policy, with the desire to learn how to apply research and data analysis to the public good through public and nonprofit applications. While I eventually determined that I'm more passionate about private and cross-sector solutions around technological innovation, this degree gave me a solid methodological foundation for pursuing my interests in leveraging the power of data for good.

      During my time at InsightsNow, the company encouraged me to seek out a Master of Business Administration and other courses to develop my skills in product management, business development and marketing. Unfortunately, when the recession hit in 2008, the impact on InsightsNow's business meant that it was no longer able to fund my education.

    <p>
        My undergraduate education at Earlham was essential to developing my analytic and critical thinking skills as a Sociology/Anthropology major with a focus on social theory and understanding systems. Earlham also cultivated my passion for social justice and civic action, and gave me the opportunity to study abroad in France, where I learned to navigate another culture and became proficient in the French language.
