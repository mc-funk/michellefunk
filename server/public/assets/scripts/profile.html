  <p>I'm a web developer working primarily with front-end JavaScript (ReactJS,
     Redux, Mocha/Chai) to help build, improve, and add features to
     <a href="https://www.exosite.com">Exosite</a>'s next-generation IoT (Internet of Things) platform, Murano.

    I'm in my second year as a software developer, after a career in market
     and evaluation research, analysis, and communications (in private, public,
     and nonprofit organizations) of more than 7 years. I hold a BS in
     Sociology/Anthropology (Earlham College) and a Master's in Public Policy
     specializing in research methodology (University of MN Humphrey School),
     and most recently completed Prime Digital Academy's intensive 18-week
     software development bootcamp as part of the Beta cohort.
